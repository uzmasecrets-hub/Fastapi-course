# Getting Started with uv

## 🐣 First uv Program

This section walks you through running your **first Python script using uv**.  
uv automatically creates an isolated environment and installs dependencies when required.

---

### 1️⃣ Create a Python Script

Create a file named **`hello.py`** with the following content:

```python
print("Hello from uv!")
```

---

### 2️⃣ Run the Script Using uv

Execute the script using uv:

```bash
uv run hello.py
```

uv will automatically resolve and install any required dependencies and then execute the script in an isolated environment.

## 📂 Project Workflow Example

A typical workflow for starting and running a new Python project with uv:

```bash
# Initialize project
uv init my-project

cd my-project

# Avtivate a Pyton environment
uv venv

(you will see line like this 
"Activate with: .venv\Scripts\activate"
copy this ".venv\Scripts\activate" and paste in your terminal)

now your environment is ready to use

# Add dependencies
uv add requests

# Lock resolved dependencies
uv lock

# Sync environment
uv sync

# Run script
uv run script.py
```
